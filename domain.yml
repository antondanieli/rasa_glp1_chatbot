        Hi! I’m the MedFinder support assistant. I can answer questions
        about how we compare tirzepatide prices and how the site works.

        Thanks for chatting with us. If you’d like to see offers, just

  utter_what_is_medfinder:
    - text: >
        MedFinder helps you compare transparent tirzepatide (GLP-1) prices
        from verified telehealth providers. We don’t sell or prescribe
        medication ourselves — we show you real discounts and options
        available where you live.

  utter_how_it_works:
    - text: >
        Here’s how MedFinder works:
        1) Answer a few quick questions to start the search.
        2) We compare top GLP-1 offers in your area, with savings that can
        reach up to about 90%.
        3) You pick an option and start saving, with medication delivered
        to your door through the provider you choose.

  utter_is_legit:
    - text: >
        Yes. MedFinder compares prices from licensed telehealth providers
        and pharmacies. Our partners are HIPAA-compliant, and we focus on
        transparent pricing with no hidden fees.

  utter_sell_medication:
    - text: >
        No. MedFinder does not sell or prescribe medication. We simply help
        you find the most affordable, legal telehealth providers offering
        tirzepatide and other GLP-1s.

  utter_price_difference:
    - text: >
        GLP-1 prices vary a lot because each clinic sets its own pricing,
        dosage options, and refill structure. That’s why people see quotes
        from around $149 up to over $1200 per month. MedFinder was built to
        bring transparency to this confusing market.

  utter_data_safe:
    - text: >
        Yes, your data is treated carefully. MedFinder does not store
        medical records or share your personal information for marketing.
        Our partners are HIPAA-compliant telehealth providers.

  utter_need_prescription:
    - text: >
        Yes, a proper medical evaluation is required. All providers we list
        require a consultation before prescribing GLP-1 medications like
        tirzepatide. MedFinder just helps you connect with those providers.

  utter_state_eligibility:
    - text: >
        Most states qualify, but availability can vary. When you click
        “Check Tirzepatide Prices in Your State” and enter your details,
        we’ll show you which options are available where you live.

  utter_prices:
    - text: >
        Prices for tirzepatide can range roughly from around $149 to over
        $1200 per month, depending on your clinic, state, and dosage.
        MedFinder compares offers so you can see clear pricing and
        potential savings — sometimes up to about 90% off typical quotes.

  utter_how_long_check_takes:
    - text: >
        The online check is fast — it usually takes about 15 seconds to
        answer the questions and see your available offers.

  utter_support:
    - text: >
        I’m here to help! You can ask me about how MedFinder works,
        pricing, safety, prescriptions, or state availability. What would
        you like to know?

  utter_out_of_scope:
    - text: >
        I’m mainly here to help with questions about MedFinder, GLP-1 price
        comparisons, and this page. Could you ask your question again, but
        related to tirzepatide or how our service works?

  utter_default:
    - text: >
        I’m not sure I understood that. Could you rephrase your question
        about MedFinder or tirzepatide pricing?

  utter_how_glp1_works:
    - text: |
        GLP-1 medications (like semaglutide and tirzepatide) mimic incretin hormones to:
        
        1. suppress appetite
        2. keep you full longer
        3. and improve blood sugar control by boosting insulin release.
        
        Tirzepatide is a dual GLP-1/GIP agonist, giving it stronger effects on weight loss and metabolism.
